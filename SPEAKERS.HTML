      <h2>Steven Soderbergh</h2>
		  <h5>VISIONARY OF THE MODERN DAY CINEMA</h5>

      <p>When a film is made today, there are big differences between the look and feel of the films when compared to older films, for example, films from Directors like Alfred Hitchcock. Modern cinematography has completely changed the way films are viewed, as we’d expect. It’s often obvious what the difference is, the industry has moved on, the budgets are higher and the technology is more advanced.</p>
	  
	  <p> Steven is going to take us on a long journey of the creation of the modern day cinema which we witness today.

      <h5>About Steven</h5>

      <p>Steven is a commercial director and has a shot over a 100s of shorts and more than 20 movies.</p>

      <h2>Bob Robertson</h2>
      <h5>POURING(WRITING) LIFE TO THE SCENE</h5>

      <p>Dialogue is the most important part of the film because it makes the film seem mature and solidly crafted. A movie with bland dialogue and cheesy lines comes off as immature and makes the screenwriter look like he didn’t try his hardest to create the best film he could</p>
	  
	  <p>Dialogue is more than just another aspect of film. It can elivate a movie to a new level. Bob will be sharing his experience as a Dialogue Writer in the film industry

      <h5>About Bob</h5>

      <p>Bob is a dialouge writer and has written for many blockbuster movies which are still relevants due to its impactful dialouges.</p>

      <h5>WHAT IT TAKES TO BE A PRODUCER</h5>

      <p>Being a producer is one of the most challenging jobs and also the most difficult to define. This possibly explains why most newcomers want to become directors and writers instead. Even at the most prestigious film schools in the world, there’s a lot more focus on courses based on directing, writing, acting and other artistic careers. But in recent times, there has been an increased appreciation for the role of a producer, more precisely a Creative Producer</p>

      <h5>About Akhilesh</h5>

      <p>Akhilesh is a well-known producer and has produced many hit films in his career</p>
